# LJ_Web_Developer

## Description

The porpace/motivation behind this project is to create a web porfolio so potention employers can see my skills and work. This wasy they can not only read on my resume my pass jobs but also see the work I have done and the skilss I have, solving the issue of employes not being able to see the scope of my skill on my resume and actually being able to see it. This project allowed me to learn how to make a web page fit different screen.
